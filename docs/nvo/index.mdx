## **ONE-LINER VERDICT**:

**NVO** is a structurally attractive long with a clearly positive expected‑value profile, anchored by strong fundamentals and a distinctive set of upcoming catalysts. The market’s current pricing reflects over‑discounted competition and execution risk relative to observable data.

**Strategy recommendation:**  

- **HOLD** existing positions; do not trim solely out of fear of near‑term volatility.  
- **ADD on weakness** into the 52–55 zone, in 1–2 tranches, provided macro and company‑specific news flow remains in line.  
- **TRIM systematically** into the 65–76 band to lock in gains and de‑risk.  
- **EXIT fully** on a decisive breakdown below the mid‑40s, or on a combination of fundamental and technical deterioration that invalidates the thesis.
